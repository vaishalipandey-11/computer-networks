# ðŸ”„ Mapping: TCP/IP vs OSI Model

Below is a clean mapping between the **5-layer TCP/IP model** and the **7-layer OSI model** with short, readable explanations.

## âœ… Layer Mapping Table

| TCP/IP Layer        | OSI Layer(s)                             | Description |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Application**     | 7. Application  6.Presentation 5.Session | Combines all high-level functions like HTTP, DNS, encryption, session control. |
| **Transport**       | 4. Transport                             | Responsible for end-to-end communication: TCP/UDP, reliability, flow control. |
| **Internet (Network)** | 3. Network                            | Routing, logical addressing, protocols like IP, ICMP, ARP. |
| **Data Link**       | 2. Data Link                             | MAC addressing, error detection, framing (Ethernet, PPP). |
| **Physical**        | 1. Physical                              | Transmits raw bits: cables, voltages, signals. |

âœ… **Tips**  
- OSI = **theoretical reference**  
- TCP/IP = **practical model used in real systems**  
- Use TCP/IP for placement prep (protocols are grouped for simplicity)
