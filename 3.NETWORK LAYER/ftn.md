# Network Layer (Layer 3) Study Notes

## Functions of the Network Layer (Layer 3)

The Network Layer ensures end-to-end delivery of packets across different networks. It plays a crucial role in internet communication and routing.

### 1. Logical Addressing

**Purpose:** To uniquely identify every device across a network.

**Address Used:** IP Address (IPv4 like 192.168.1.2 or IPv6 like 2001:db8::1)

**Why Needed:**
- MAC addresses are local and physical (specific to a device's NIC)
- To route data across global networks, we need IP addresses
- Logical addressing allows devices on different networks to communicate

**Example:**
```
Sender IP:     192.168.1.2
Receiver IP:   172.217.160.78 (e.g., google.com)
```

Every data packet must carry the source and destination IP address. Without this, routing won't work.

### 2. Routing

**Purpose:** To determine the best possible path for the packet to travel from source to destination.

**How It Works:**
- Routers examine the destination IP
- They use routing tables to decide the best next-hop route
- This happens dynamically at every intermediate router

**Algorithms Used:**
- **Distance Vector** ‚Äì e.g., RIP (Routing Information Protocol)
- **Link State** ‚Äì e.g., OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)
- **Hybrid** ‚Äì e.g., EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)
- ## Routing Protocols
| Type            | Example | Info Shared                  | Algorithm      | Best For              |
| --------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| Distance Vector | RIP     | Full table periodically      | Bellman-Ford   | Small/simple networks |
| Link State      | OSPF    | Link-state database (LSAs)   | Dijkstra (SPF) | Large networks        |
| Hybrid          | EIGRP   | Neighbors + partial updates  | DUAL           | Medium/Large networks |


**Key Point:** Routing adapts in real-time to network changes like link failure or congestion.

### 3. Packet Forwarding

**Purpose:** To move the packet from one node (router) to the next until it reaches its destination.

**How It Works:**
At each hop (router), the router:
1. Looks up the destination IP
2. Uses its routing table to choose the next-hop
3. Forwards the packet accordingly

This repeats until the packet reaches the final destination.

**Forwarding vs Routing:**

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Routing | Decision-making: selects the path |
| Forwarding | Actual transfer of packets along the path |

### 4. Fragmentation & Reassembly

**Purpose:** To handle data that's too large for the transmission path (larger than the MTU).

**Fragmentation:**
- Performed when packet size > MTU
- Happens at source device or intermediate routers
- Packet is split into smaller fragments

Each fragment includes:
- Identification number
- Fragment offset
- More Fragments (MF) flag

**Reassembly:**
- Done at the destination
- Fragments are combined based on offset values and MF flag
- If any fragment is lost, entire reassembly fails

**Example:**
```
Suppose MTU = 1500 bytes
If a 4000-byte packet is sent:
It is divided into 3 fragments:
- 1500 bytes
- 1500 bytes
- 1000 bytes
```

- **MAC** ‚Üí Local hardware ID (private, not shared on internet).
- **IP** ‚Üí Logical address (needed for sending/receiving data).
- **Port** ‚Üí Endpoint for application-level communication.


## 2. IP Addressing

### IPv4
- 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- Written in dotted decimal format
- Divided into network and host parts

### IPv6
- 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:0db8::1)
- Used to overcome IPv4 exhaustion
- Written in hexadecimal and supports more devices

### IPv4 Address Classes

| Class | Range | Default Subnet Mask | Use Case |
|-------|-------|-------------------|----------|
| A | 0.0.0.0 ‚Äì 127.255.255.255 | 255.0.0.0 | Large networks |
| B | 128.0.0.0 ‚Äì 191.255.255.255 | 255.255.0.0 | Medium networks |
| C | 192.0.0.0 ‚Äì 223.255.255.255 | 255.255.255.0 | Small networks |
| D | 224.0.0.0 ‚Äì 239.255.255.255 | ‚Äî | Multicasting |
| E | 240.0.0.0 ‚Äì 255.255.255.255 | ‚Äî | Research |

Trick ‚Üí Start at A=127, then add:  
B (+64), C (+32), D (+16), E (rest)

### Public vs Private IPs

**Private IP (used in LANs):**
- Class A: 10.0.0.0 ‚Äì 10.255.255.255
- Class B: 172.16.0.0 ‚Äì 172.31.255.255
- Class C: 192.168.0.0 ‚Äì 192.168.255.255

**Public IP:** Routable on the internet, assigned by ISPs.

### Static vs Dynamic IPs
- **Static IP:** Manually assigned, doesn't change
- **Dynamic IP:** Assigned by DHCP, changes periodically

### CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)
- Removes dependency on classes (A/B/C)
- Uses prefix notation like 192.168.1.0/24
- /24 means 24 bits for network, 8 for hosts

- ## Common CIDR Notations
| CIDR | Subnet Mask     | Usable Hosts       | Use Case              |
| ---- | --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| /8   | 255.0.0.0       | ~16 million       | Very large networks   |
| /16  | 255.255.0.0     | ~65,000           | Medium networks       |
| /24  | 255.255.255.0   | 254               | Home/small office     |
| /30  | 255.255.255.252 | 2                 | Point-to-point links  |

üëâ Formula:  
`Usable hosts = 2^(32 - prefix) - 2`

**Interview Tip:** Know how to calculate no. of hosts in a subnet:
```
Formula: No. of hosts = 2^(32 - subnet bits) - 2
Example: /24 ‚Üí 2^(32-24) - 2 = 254 hosts
```

## 3. Subnetting & Supernetting

### Subnetting
- Divides a large network into smaller sub-networks (subnets)
- Helps in better IP address management and network isolation
- Uses a subnet mask or CIDR notation (e.g., /24)

**Example:**
```
192.168.1.0/24 ‚Üí can be subnetted into:
192.168.1.0/26, 192.168.1.64/26, etc.
```

**Host Calculation:**
```
Formula: 2^(32 - subnet bits) - 2
Ex: /26 ‚Üí 2‚Å∂ - 2 = 62 hosts per subnet
```

### Supernetting
- Combines multiple networks into a larger one
- Used mainly in route aggregation to reduce routing table size
- Often seen in ISP-level routing

**Example:**
```
Combining:
192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.1.0/24 ‚Üí becomes 192.168.0.0/23
```

## 4. IPv4 Packet Format

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Version** | IPv4 = `4` |
| **Header Length** | Size of header in 32-bit words (usually 20 bytes) |
| **Total Length** | Entire packet size (header + data) in bytes |
| **TTL (Time To Live)** | Limits packet lifetime to avoid infinite loops |
| **Protocol** | Indicates upper layer protocol (e.g., `6` = TCP, `17` = UDP) |
| **Source IP** | IP address of sender |
| **Destination IP** | IP address of receiver |
| **Checksum** | Error checking of header |
| **Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset** | Used for fragmentation & reassembly |

**Important Note:** TTL (Time To Live) is decremented by 1 at each hop. If TTL = 0, the packet is discarded ‚Üí prevents infinite routing loops.

## 6. Types of Routing

| **Type** | **Description** |
|----------|----------------|
| **Static** | Manually configured routes by network admin |
| **Dynamic** | Routers **automatically learn** routes using routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF) |
| **Default** | Used when **no specific route** is found; acts as a **fallback path** (e.g., `0.0.0.0/0`) |

## 7. Routing Algorithms

| **Algorithm** | **Description** |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Distance Vector** | Chooses path based on **hop count** (shortest path). Example: **RIP** |
| **Link State** | Builds a **full map** of the network and computes best path using Dijkstra's algorithm. Example: **OSPF** |
| **Path Vector** | Maintains **path information** with policies, mainly used **between ISPs**. Example: **BGP** |

## 8. Routing Protocols

| **Protocol** | **Type** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------|----------------|
| **RIP** | Distance Vector | Uses **hop count** as metric (max 15 hops). Simple but slow |
| **OSPF** | Link State | Builds complete **network topology**. Fast convergence, widely used in enterprises |
| **BGP** | Path Vector | Used for **Internet routing** between ISPs (Autonomous Systems). Supports **policy-based routing** |

## 9. NAT (Network Address Translation)

### What is NAT?
NAT translates private IP addresses (used inside a LAN) into a public IP address (used on the internet), allowing devices in a private network to access the internet using a single public IP.

### Why is NAT Used?
- Conserves public IP addresses
- Provides basic security by hiding internal IPs
- Enables multiple devices to share one public IP

### Types of NAT

| **Type** | **Description** |
|----------|----------------|
| **Static NAT** | One-to-one mapping of private IP ‚Üî public IP |
| **Dynamic NAT** | Maps private IPs to a **pool** of public IPs |
| **PAT (Port Address Translation)** | Many-to-one mapping using **ports** to distinguish devices (aka **NAT Overload**) |

**Key Point:** PAT is the most common form of NAT, allowing hundreds of devices to share a single IP using different port numbers.

**Example:**
```
Private IP: 192.168.1.10 ‚Üí Public IP: 203.0.113.5:5050
Another Device: 192.168.1.11 ‚Üí 203.0.113.5:5051
```

### Interview Tips
- **"Does NAT break end-to-end connectivity?"** Yes, it modifies IP headers, affecting peer-to-peer apps
- **"Where is NAT implemented?"** On routers or firewalls at the network boundary
- **"Can NAT be used with IPv6?"** NAT is not preferred in IPv6 as it offers enough addresses natively

## 10. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)

### What is ARP?
ARP maps a known IP address to its corresponding MAC address within a local network (LAN).

### Why is it needed?
- Devices communicate using MAC addresses at the Data Link Layer
- If a device knows the IP but not the MAC, it sends an ARP Request to find it

### How it works:
1. **ARP Request:** Broadcasted: "Who has IP 192.168.1.1? Tell me your MAC."
2. **ARP Reply:** The device with that IP replies with its MAC address
3. The sender stores the mapping in its ARP cache

**Key Points:**
- Only works in IPv4 networks
- Operates at Layer 2 (Data Link) but assists Layer 3 (Network)
- Used only within the same LAN/subnet ‚Äî not across routers

**Interview Tip:** ARP is used when the destination IP is known, but the MAC address is unknown ‚Äî typical during the first packet transmission.

## 11. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

### What is ICMP?
ICMP is used by network devices (like routers) to send error messages and diagnostic/control information. It is not used for data transfer, but for network health and troubleshooting.

### Common ICMP Use Cases

| **Use Case** | **ICMP Type** | **Description** |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Ping** | Echo Request / Echo Reply | Tests connectivity between two devices |
| **Destination Unreachable** | Type 3 | Receiver or network not reachable |
| **Time Exceeded** | Type 11 | TTL expired (used in traceroute) |
| **Redirect** | Type 5 | Suggests a better route to the host |

**Key Points:**
- ICMP is encapsulated in IP packets (protocol number: 1)
- Works with both IPv4 and IPv6 (ICMPv6)
- Routers and hosts generate ICMP messages to report network issues

**Interview Tip:**
- Ping uses ICMP to measure round-trip time and packet loss
- Traceroute relies on ICMP "Time Exceeded" messages to map the route

## 12. Fragmentation

### What is Fragmentation?
When an IP packet is larger than the MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) of the network, it is split into smaller fragments for transmission.

Example: If MTU = 1500 bytes and a packet is 4000 bytes ‚Üí it is fragmented.

### Who handles it?
- **IP layer (Network Layer)** handles fragmentation and reassembly
- **Fragmentation:** At the sender or an intermediate router
- **Reassembly:** Only at the destination host

### Key IPv4 Header Fields for Fragmentation

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Identification** | Identifies which fragments belong to the same original packet |
| **Fragment Offset** | Indicates position of this fragment in the original packet |
| **More Fragments (MF)** | Bit set to 1 if more fragments follow; 0 if last fragment |

**Example:**
```
A 4000-byte packet over a 1500-byte MTU link ‚Üí split into 3 fragments:
1st: bytes 0‚Äì1499
2nd: bytes 1500‚Äì2999
3rd: bytes 3000‚Äì3999
```

**Interview Tip:**
- Fragmentation is inefficient and should be avoided using Path MTU Discovery
- IPv6 does not allow routers to fragment; only the sender can do it

- ## Fragmentation and Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)

### üîπ Why Fragmentation is Inefficient
**Fragmentation** = splitting a large IP packet into smaller chunks so it can pass through a network with a smaller **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**.

**Problems:**
- **Overhead** ‚Äì Each fragment carries its own IP header (waste of bandwidth).  
- **Processing load** ‚Äì Routers & receivers must reassemble fragments ‚Üí slows things down.  
- **Loss amplification** ‚Äì If **one fragment** is lost, the entire packet must be retransmitted.  
- **Security risks** ‚Äì Fragmentation can be exploited in attacks (e.g., evading firewalls with tiny fragments).  

‚úÖ Therefore, modern networking tries to **avoid fragmentation**.

---

### üîπ Path MTU Discovery (PMTUD)
**Goal:** Find the largest packet size that can travel end-to-end **without fragmentation**.

**How it works (IPv4):**
1. Sender sets the **DF (Don‚Äôt Fragment)** bit in the IP header.  
2. If a router along the path encounters a packet larger than its MTU, it **drops the packet** and sends back an **ICMP ‚ÄúFragmentation Needed‚Äù** message.  
3. Sender reduces packet size and retries ‚Üí until it finds a size that passes.  

‚úÖ This way, the sender automatically adjusts packet size ‚Üí **no fragmentation required**.

---

### üîπ Why IPv6 Does Not Allow Routers to Fragment
In **IPv6**, only the **sender** can fragment packets. Routers are **not allowed** to do it.  

**Reasons:**
- Routers should forward packets as fast as possible ‚Üí no time wasted in splitting/reassembling.  
- Responsibility lies with the **sender** (who can use PMTUD to choose the proper size).  
- Simplifies router design & improves performance.  


## 13. Switching Techniques

Switching determines how data moves between devices in a network.

### 1. Circuit Switching
- Dedicated path is established before transmission
- Resources remain reserved for the entire session
- Example: Traditional telephone networks

**Pros:** Guaranteed bandwidth, low latency  
**Cons:** Wastes resources if no data is sent

### 2. Packet Switching
- Data is divided into small packets, sent independently
- Packets may take different routes and are reassembled at the destination
- Example: Internet, IP-based communication

**Pros:** Efficient, scalable, handles bursty traffic  
**Cons:** May cause delay, jitter, or packet loss

### 3. Message Switching
- Entire message is stored at each intermediate node before forwarding (Store-and-Forward)
- No fixed path or packetization

**Used in:** Early telegraph/email systems  
**Cons:** High storage & delay, not suitable for real-time apps

**Interview Tip:**
- The Internet uses packet switching, not circuit switching
- Circuit switching is more suitable for voice; packet switching for data

## 14. Network Devices (Layer 3)

### Router
- Connects different networks (e.g., LAN to Internet)
- Uses IP addresses to route packets
- Works at Network Layer (Layer 3) of the OSI model
- Maintains and uses a routing table

Example: Home Wi-Fi router connecting your LAN to the Internet.

### Layer 3 Switch
- A switch with routing capabilities
- Performs routing within a LAN or VLANs
- Faster than routers for internal traffic due to hardware-based routing

- ### üîπ Quick Comparison Table

| Feature               | Switch                          | Router                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| OSI Layer              | Layer 2 (Data Link)            | Layer 3 (Network)               |
| Works with             | MAC Address                    | IP Address                      |
| Purpose                | Connect devices in a LAN       | Connect different networks      |
| Scope                  | Local (LAN)                    | Wide (LAN ‚Üî WAN / Internet)     |
| Main Function          | Forward frames                 | Forward packets (routing)       |
| Extra Features         | VLAN, Port Security            | NAT, DHCP, Firewall, VPN        |


Used in enterprise LANs for inter-VLAN routing.

**Interview Tip:**

**Router vs Layer 3 Switch:**
Both route using IP, but Layer 3 switches are optimized for speed in LANs, while routers are for WAN/internet connectivity.

## 15. Tunneling & VPN Basics

### Tunneling
- Encapsulates one packet inside another
- Enables data to pass through incompatible networks or bypass restrictions
- Often used to carry private traffic over a public network

Example: IPv6 packets inside IPv4 using 6to4 tunneling.

## 6to4 Tunneling (IPv6 over IPv4)

üîπ Problem:  
- IPv6 is the future, but most of today‚Äôs Internet still runs on IPv4.  
- Direct IPv6 ‚Üî IPv4 communication is not possible.  

üîπ Solution:  
- Use **tunneling**: encapsulate IPv6 packets **inside IPv4 packets**.  
- One such method is **6to4 tunneling**.

---

### How 6to4 Works
1. IPv6 packet is created by the host.
2. Before sending, it is **wrapped inside an IPv4 packet**.
3. The IPv4 header carries it across the IPv4 network.
4. At the other end, the IPv4 header is stripped off, leaving the original IPv6 packet.

---

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)

# VPN (Virtual Private Network)

## üîπ What is a VPN?
A **VPN** creates a secure, encrypted connection (a "tunnel") between your device and a remote server over the public Internet.  
It makes your online activities private, secure, and can also mask your IP address.

---

## üîπ How VPN Works
1. You connect to a VPN server (using VPN software).
2. Your data is **encrypted** before leaving your device.
3. The encrypted data travels over the Internet ‚Üí preventing snooping by ISPs, hackers, or governments.
4. The VPN server decrypts the data and forwards it to the final destination.
5. Response comes back the same way (encrypted ‚Üí through VPN ‚Üí to you).

---

## üîπ Key Features
- **Encryption** ‚Üí Protects data from eavesdropping.  
- **Anonymity** ‚Üí Hides your real IP; websites see VPN server IP.  
- **Bypass Restrictions** ‚Üí Access geo-blocked or censored content.  
- **Remote Access** ‚Üí Employees securely connect to company networks.

---

## üîπ Types of VPN
1. **Remote Access VPN**  
   - Used by individuals to connect securely to a private network (e.g., company network).
   
2. **Site-to-Site VPN**  
   - Connects two entire networks (e.g., branch office ‚Üî headquarters).
   
3. **Client-to-Site VPN**  
   - Employees use VPN clients to connect to a corporate VPN gateway.

---

## üîπ VPN Protocols
- **PPTP** ‚Äì Old, fast, but weak security.  
- **L2TP/IPSec** ‚Äì Secure, but slower.  
- **OpenVPN** ‚Äì Widely used, strong security.  
- **IKEv2/IPSec** ‚Äì Secure and good for mobile devices.  
- **WireGuard** ‚Äì Modern, fast, and lightweight.

---

## üîπ Advantages
- Secure communication on public Wi-Fi.
- Hides browsing activity from ISPs.
- Helps bypass geo-blocks & censorship.
- Protects sensitive corporate data.

## üîπ Disadvantages
- Can slow down connection speed.
- Some websites block VPN traffic.
- Trust in VPN provider is required (they can see your traffic after decryption).


**Protocols used:** IPSec, PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN, WireGuard

**Interview Tip:** VPN uses tunneling, but not all tunneling is encrypted. VPN adds encryption, authentication, and integrity checks.

## 16. IPv6 Concepts

### Key Features of IPv6

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **128-bit Addressing** | Supports **2¬π¬≤‚Å∏** addresses ‚Äì solves IPv4 exhaustion |
| **No NAT Required** | Every device can have a **unique global address** |
| **Simplified Header** | Fewer fields ‚Üí faster processing by routers |
| **Built-in IPsec** | Native support for **encryption & authentication** |
| **Auto-configuration** | Stateless Address Auto Config (SLAAC) for plug-and-play networking |

**Example IPv6 Address:**
```
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334
Can be shortened to: 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334
```

**Interview Tip:** IPv6 eliminates the need for NAT, supports end-to-end connectivity, and improves QoS & security through IPsec.

## 17. Logical Addressing vs Physical Addressing

| **Aspect** | **Logical Addressing (IP)** | **Physical Addressing (MAC)** |
|------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Type** | Software-based | Hardware-based (burned into NIC) |
| **Changes Across Networks** | ‚úÖ Yes (can be reassigned) | ‚ùå No (fixed per device) |
| **OSI Layer** | Network Layer (Layer 3) | Data Link Layer (Layer 2) |
| **Format** | IPv4: 32-bit / IPv6: 128-bit | 48-bit hexadecimal (e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C...`) |
| **Purpose** | Uniquely identifies device **across networks** | Identifies device **within a local network** |
| **Example** | `192.168.1.5` | `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` |


## Data Units
| Unit            | Equal To     |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| 1 Byte (B)      | 8 bits       |
| 1 KB            | 1024 Bytes   |
| 1 MB            | 1024 KB      |
| 1 GB            | 1024 MB      |
üëâ Conversions:  
- Bits ‚Üí Bytes: √∑8  
- Bytes ‚Üí Bits: √ó8  
- Binary ‚Üí Hex: Group bits in 4s  
- Hex ‚Üí Binary: Expand each hex digit into 4 bits  

**Interview Tip:**
- IP address is temporary and logical, MAC is permanent and physical
- IP is used for routing, MAC is used for local delivery
