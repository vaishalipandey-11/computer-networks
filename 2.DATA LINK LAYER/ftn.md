## âœ… 1. Functions of the Data Link Layer

- Framing (grouping bits into frames)
- Error detection and correction
- Flow control
- Medium Access Control (MAC)
- Addressing via MAC addresses

---

## âœ… 2. Framing (Function of Data Link Layer)

### ðŸ”¹ What is Framing?
Framing is the process of grouping a stream of bits into structured units called **frames**, so that they can be transmitted and understood correctly.

> Without framing, the receiver wouldnâ€™t know where a message starts or ends.

### ðŸ”¹ How it Works
The Data Link Layer adds **headers and trailers** around the data:

- **Header**: Contains metadata like source/destination MAC addresses, control info.
- **Trailer**: Often includes error-checking code (like CRC).

### âž• This helps:
- Recognize start and end of each frame.
- Provide error detection and addressing.

### ðŸ”¹ Framing Techniques

#### âœ… Byte Stuffing (Character-Oriented Protocols)
- Uses special characters (like `FLAG`) to mark frame boundaries.
- If the `FLAG` appears in data, insert an **escape** character before it.

**Example:**

  Data: Hello FLAG World
Stuffed: Hello ESC FLAG World
Frame delimiter: a unique bit pattern (e.g., 01111110)

   
#### âœ… Bit Stuffing (Bit-Oriented Protocols)
- Frame delimiter: a unique bit pattern (e.g., `01111110`)
- If sender detects **5 consecutive 1s**, it adds a 0 after them.
- Receiver removes the extra 0s during decoding.

### ðŸ”¹ Why Framing is Important

| Feature          | Why It Matters                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clear Boundaries | Receiver knows where one frame ends, and another starts |
| Reliability      | Helps in **error checking** using trailers (like CRC)   |
| Control          | Ensures proper **flow control** and synchronization     |

## âœ… 3. Error Detection & Correction (Data Link Layer)

### ðŸ”¹ Error Detection
Used to detect errors introduced during transmission.

**Techniques:**
- **Parity Bit**: Adds one bit to make number of 1s even/odd.
- **Checksum**: Adds all data bytes; result is sent along. Receiver re-calculates.
- **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check)**:
  - Treats data as binary number & divides by fixed polynomial.
  - Remainder (CRC bits) is added.
  - Receiver re-divides to check for errors.

### âœ… Error Correction

Ensures that the receiver can **fix errors** with or without retransmission.

#### ðŸ”¹ Hamming Code
- Adds **redundant bits** to the data.
- Can detect & correct **single-bit errors**.
- Uses **position-based parity** checks.

#### ðŸ”¹ ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest)
- Uses **ACKs** and **timeouts**.
- If error or no ACK â†’ resend.

**Types:**
- Stop-and-Wait ARQ
- Go-Back-N ARQ
- Selective Repeat ARQ

### âœ… Comparison: Stop-and-Wait vs Go-Back-N vs Selective Repeat

| Feature                | Stop-and-Wait ARQ       | Go-Back-N ARQ                       | Selective Repeat ARQ                |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Frames Sent            | One at a time           | Multiple (within window)          | Multiple (within window)            |
| ACK                    | After each frame        | Cumulative ACK                    | Individual ACKs                     |
| On Error               | Resend that frame       | Resend that frame + all after     | Resend only the erroneous frame     |

## âœ… 4. Flow Control (Data Link Layer)

### ðŸ”¹ Purpose
Prevents sender from sending data **faster** than the receiver can process.

### ðŸ”¹ Techniques

#### âœ… Stop-and-Wait
- Sender sends one frame and **waits for ACK**.
- Simple but inefficient.

#### âœ… Sliding Window Protocol
- Sender sends **multiple frames** up to a window size.
- Receiver acknowledges received frames.
- Efficient for **high-speed networks**.

- **Slotted ALOHA**: Transmit at slot start (~37% efficiency)

#### âœ… 2. CSMA/CD (Wired Ethernet)
- **Carrier Sense**: Listen before transmit
- **Collision Detection**: Stop + backoff
- Used in **half-duplex Ethernet**

#### âœ… 3. CSMA/CA (Wi-Fi)
- Canâ€™t detect collisions â†’ **avoids** them
- Uses **RTS/CTS** (Request/Clear to Send)
- Suitable for **wireless networks**

## âœ… 7. MAC Addressing (Media Access Control Address)

### ðŸ”¹ What is a MAC Address?
A **unique identifier** assigned to a deviceâ€™s Network Interface Card (NIC).

### ðŸ”¹ Format
- 48-bit address (hexadecimal)
- Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`
- First 24 bits: **OUI** (manufacturer)
- Last 24 bits: **Device-specific ID**

### ðŸ”¹ Usage
- Used by Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Switches to deliver frames.
- Used **within a LAN** (Layer 2).
- **Switches** use MAC to forward frames accurately.

### ðŸ”¹ Key Points
- MAC is **hardware-based**.
- Not routable like IP.
- Used for **local delivery** only.

| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Switch**                      | Operates at **Layer 2**. Uses MAC addresses to forward frames. Maintains MAC address table.     |
| **Bridge**                      | Connects two LAN segments. Filters traffic based on MAC. Segments networks.                    |
| **NIC (Network Interface Card)**| Connects device to network. Has unique MAC. Responsible for frame transmission/reception.      |

## âœ… 9. Switching Techniques (Layer 2 Switches)

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Store-and-Forward Switching
- Switch receives **entire frame**, checks CRC, then forwards.
- Reliable, but slower.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Cut-Through Switching
- Starts forwarding after reading **destination MAC**.
- Faster, but may forward **corrupted frames**.

### ðŸ”¹ Frame Communication Types

| Type      | Communication | Delivered To              | MAC Address Used                  |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Unicast   | One-to-One    | Specific single device    | Unique MAC address                |
| Multicast | One-to-Group  | Selected group of devices | Multicast MAC (e.g., 01:00:5E...) |
| Broadcast | One-to-All    | All devices in the LAN    | `FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF`               |
